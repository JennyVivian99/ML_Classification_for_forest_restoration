Codes on ML classification algorithms used are provided here.
The techniques considered are:
  - KNN
  - SVMs
  - Decision tree
  - Adaptive boosting (Adaboost)
In each code, data preprocessing and standardization/normalization are present.
For Decision tree and Adaboost, the code also contains the analysis with merged classes, which was not implemented using KNN and SVMs, given
their lower accuracy obtained with the original dataset compared to the other two algorithms.

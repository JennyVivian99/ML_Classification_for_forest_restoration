## Code for ML classification to unravel (forest) ecosystem restoration ##

The code considers the protocol visible at [protocols.io](dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.6qpvrwj2zlmk/v1), 
using the ML algorithms and related techniques explained in [pre-print](). Please refer to the cited publication for details on the techniques and methodology.

Briefly, it includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Data standardization or normalization, depending on the case
- ML clustering
- ML classification
- ML classification with merged classes of the wrongly assigned samples
- Verification of the statistical difference among the accuracies calculated

Note: Data preprocessing, and standardisation/normalization are present in each code, along with the environment preparation
